 #**`2DPlatformer`**

A common 2d platformer made with godot. This project was made to expand/hone my skills and to have fun. 
There for it does not have anything that out ordinary for a 2d platformer except the code choices and some of the layout. 
Most of the game assists come from free/open source places like opengameart.org
